# Yongatek Microelectronics Internship Project 

This is a floating point arithmetics project for Nexys 4 DDR board.  Top module receives 11 byte packets in accordance with UART protocol.If header and footer bytes are the requested ones (x"BA" and x"DB"), then it processes various arithmetic operations. The second byte is the command byte (x"00"=> '+' | x"01"=> '-' | x"02"=> '*' | x"03"=> '/' ). Other 8 bytes' first 4 are a floating point number which is based on IEEE 754 standards. Remanining bytes also represent a IEEE 754 floating point number. Top module applies necessary arithmetics and returns a new 6 byte packet. This packet has both header and footer, in addition to resultant. Necessary modules are available. There are coded test benches for almost all submodules. Also sample packets have been generated with Matlab and recorded in a text file : "1000_data_i.txt". Calculated final packets with Matlab are recorded in a different text file : "1000_data_o.txt". Finally the sample packets have given to top module in a test bench and outputs have been taken to "1000_data_w.txt".Lastly, with the help of a Matlab script, errors have been compared and plotted.
